## Using this definition

While the definition itself works unmodified, you can select the version of Node.js the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "12" }
```

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/base.Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own `Dockerfile` with one of the following:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:14`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:12`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:10`

You can decide how often you want updates by referencing a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of each image. For example:

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-11`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0.200-11`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0.200.0-11`

See [here for a complete list of available tags](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node/tags/list).

Alternatively, you can use the contents of the `Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

Beyond Node.js and `git`, this image / `Dockerfile` includes `eslint`, `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development. [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (`nvm`) is also included in case you need to use a different version of Node.js than the one included in the image.

### Adding the definition to a project or codespace

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. To use the pre-built image:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.
   3. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

3. To build a custom version of the image instead:
   1. Clone this repository locally.
   2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   3. Use your local operating system's file explorer to drag-and-drop the locally cloned copy of the `.devcontainer` folder for this definition into the VS Code file explorer for your opened project or codespace.
   4. Update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to reference `"dockerfile": "base.Dockerfile"`.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/javascript-node` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project. This will automatically run `npm install` before starting it.
6. Once the project is running, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select **Remote-Containers: Forward Port from Container...**
7. Select port 3000 and click the "Open Browser" button in the notification that appears.
8. You should see "Hello remote world!" after the page loads.
9. From here, you can add breakpoints or edit the contents of the `test-project` folder to do further testing.
